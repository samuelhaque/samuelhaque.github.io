				<p>I am a second year computer science looking to work closely with software to create something amazing. I believe teamwork and team chemistry is the most successful way to elivate software standards. However I believe creating work individually to help the team is also a usefull skill. Therefore this website is intended to be a platform to share projects i have previously made/been a part of. </p>
